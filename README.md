## Project Description

This small project consist of an aggregation of self-implemented data structures, algorithm in the goal to achieve a better understanding of the basic libraries used daily in Java programming. Also basic Java software designs like designs patterns were used to strengthen the overall structure. The list of concept covered are as followed:

### Data Structure
  - List
  - Array List
  - Singly-Linked List
  - Doubly-Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
  - Tree
  - Binary Tree
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree

### Search Algorithm
  - Binary Search
  
### Sorting Algorithm
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
